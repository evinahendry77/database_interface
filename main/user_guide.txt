	This application was developed to provide a basic, low-overhead database with a high-level command line-based front end. The application was designed primarily with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind, while remaining secure and only accessible to administrators. This is made possible through AWS’s use of security groups and related configurations. 
	Even with the requirement for administrative access, the principle of layered security has been followed. In the case that an attacker gains unauthorized access to the program, the menu’s input has been validated in such a way that any injection-based attacks (notably SQL) are made immensely more difficult. This program is obviously not invulnerable, but even providing limited input validation can deter the casual attacker that’s out there searching for “low-hanging fruits”, as they say.
	This code is intended to be open-source and is publicly available on my GitHub account. I expect that any clones or pulls will be done with improvement or workplace use in mind. This program should not be plagiarized for academic use; maybe you’ll get away with it, but if you really have to plagiarize, you probably aren’t developing the skills necessary to do well in this industry.
	Aside from providing a friend with a usable database front end, I developed this application to provide a template for security and penetration testing. I’m a security specialist by trade, and I’ve been experimenting with writing secure code and then attempting to “break” it.
	For my own security purposes, I’ve renamed the storage bucket and removed any information that identifies my AWS account. Make sure you set your own storage bucket information where I have indicated. Also make sure that you’re using AWS Cloud9 and that you’ve installed boto3 (“pip3 install boto3”) in the command line. This will make the program work as it is intended. Once you’ve done that, feel free to edit and pen test this program as you will. It’s for public use! 
Thanks!
